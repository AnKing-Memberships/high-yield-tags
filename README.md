# Analyzing tag
## Rationale
This add-on was commissioned by u/DoctorToBeIn23 on reddit. When using
advanced tags, it may become useful to know how many tags are present
in a set of cards selected in the browser. This add-on allows you to
access to this informations. Tags are sorted in decreasing number of
occurence. 

A third column show the percent of cards with this tags which are
currently selected.

Finally, you can ask to highlight tags containing some particular words.
## Configuration
There are two configurations: 
* a default list of words to higlights. 
* whether you want to remember the list of words to higlights.
